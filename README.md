In a conventional vehicle, the driver's power demand is met by the only available energy source, the combustion engine (ICE). In HEVs, a further decision must be made regarding how to distribute the driver's power demand among the various available energy sources. Therefore, an energy management strategy (EMS) is required to determine the power distribution at any given time.

This work focuses on optimizing the power flow between the energy sources (ICE and EM), which constitute the powertrain of a HEV with parallel architecture, over a defined horizon. Optimization involves deciding the amount of power supplied at any given time by the on-board energy sources, based on the power requested, through the development of various control or energy management strategies (EMSs). The aim is to seek an optimal trade-off between total fuel consumption and the loss of energy stored in the battery (Charge-Sustaining) over a defined optimization horizon, satisfying the required power and respecting all operating constraints. The performance of control strategies is tested and compared by simulating standardized driving cycles that emulate different driving conditions (urban, extra-urban, combined). Specifically, driving cycles provide speed fluctuations over time, which allow us to understand how the vehicle behaves, that is, how the powertrain operates most of the time (acceleration, tractive effort, torque, power, etc.).

Energy management in HEVs requires meeting a series of constraints that can be local and/or global. When making a control decision, the implemented strategy must be able to account for the physical limitations of the powertrain components, such as the maximum ICE torque or the minimum battery current, which constitute local constraints. Furthermore, the value of a certain system state variable may also be subject to a predefined requirement. For example, local constraints are often applied to maintain the battery SoC within a predefined range. On the other hand, a target SoC value at the end of the driving cycle is most often required.

Among the various optimal control techniques, analytical optimization methods use an analytical problem formulation to find a solution to the energy management problem in HEVs. Furthermore, they can be used to make the numerical solution faster than that obtained using a purely numerical method, such as dynamic programming (DP). The Pontryagin Minimum Principle (PMP) is one of the most widely used analytical control approaches for the energy management of HEVs. It has been shown that, under certain conditions, PMP provides a non-causal, globally optimal solution.
In the field of model-based control methods that can be implemented in real time, several research efforts have been dedicated to the adaptive equivalent consumption minimization (A-ECMS) strategy, a variant of the equivalent minimum consumption strategy (ECMS).

The Pontryagin Minimum Principle (PMP) and the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) are energy management strategies that allow the optimal distribution of the power to be supplied to the wheels (already known a priori from the driving cycle) between the ICE and EM at any given moment in time, based on the imposed system constraints, for optimal fuel economy and emissions reduction. In other words, the aim of these techniques is to minimize a cost function, such as fuel consumption, through optimal control of the energy flow, respecting the various boundary conditions (system constraints).
